# Food-Order-System
A Food Order System project is a software application designed to enable customers to order food from a restaurant or food service provider, either via a web or mobile interface. This system can simplify the food ordering process, making it more efficient for both customers and the restaurant staff.
Key Components:
User Interface (UI):

Customer Portal: A web or mobile app where users can view menus, place orders, and pay online. Customers can browse through different categories, view food items, select their choices, and customize orders (e.g., add extra toppings, select portion size).
Admin/Restaurant Portal: A separate interface for restaurant staff to manage orders, view customer details, update order status, and manage the menu (add, edit, remove items).
Menu Management:

Restaurants can add and edit food items with descriptions, prices, availability, and images.
Menu items are categorized (e.g., Appetizers, Main Course, Beverages, Desserts).
Order Management:

Customers can place orders by selecting items, choosing quantities, and adding special instructions.
Orders are tracked with statuses such as "Received," "In Preparation," "Out for Delivery," or "Completed."
Notifications can be sent to customers about their order status.
Payment Integration:




Search and Filter:

Customers can search for food items by keywords, ingredients, or categories.
Filter options by price, dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free), or restaurant ratings.

Reviews and Feedback:

Customers can leave reviews and rate their food or overall service experience, which helps improve quality.

Coupons and Discounts:

Restaurants can offer promotions, discounts, or loyalty programs for frequent users.
Reports and Analytics (for Admins):

Sales reports, customer order histories, and other data analytics to help restaurant managers track performance.
Technologies Used:
